## Bhagwat Chate – FAANG-Grade GenAI Projects

Welcome to **genai-blueprints** – a master repository that curates all my production-grade projects in **Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM orchestration, and Agentic AI**.

Each project listed here is designed with enterprise-grade standards, modular design, and readiness for scale. These blueprints are crafted to reflect the skills and architecture expected of a **GenAI Architect** at top-tier companies like Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft.
